I am a software engineer, specializing in web development using NodeJS, MongoDB and React.

I aspire to write clean, maintainable code and am constantly learning to improve my skills.

### My Projects

#### [URL Shortener Microservice](https://github.com/min49/url-shortener)
Simplified version of TinyURL, written with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB (mongoose). Code components separated into routes, controllers, business entities, and database models to make changes to the project easy.

#### [Calculator](https://github.com/min49/calculator)
Created with React, it features comma separated digit display, fixed maximum digits, and keyboard input handling to mimic physical calculators.
